# CypressAPI Project

## Overview
CypressAPI is a project designed to demonstrate API testing using Cypress. This project includes a series of tests to validate the functionality of various API endpoints, ensuring their reliability and performance.

- **editor code used: vscode**
- **Library Versions:**
    ```bash
     cypress-mochawesome-reporter
    
   ```
## Application under the test
- The application under test is available at [QA Challenge API](https://qachallenge.ro/api/). This API provides various endpoints for testing purposes, allowing the validation of different functionalities and scenarios.


## Features
- **Automated API Testing**: Uses Cypress to automate the testing of API endpoints.
- **Test Scenarios**: Includes comprehensive test scenarios to cover different use cases.
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple setup and configuration to start testing immediately.

# issue Report: Unable to Delete User with Invalid ID Key

## description
The API endpoint for deleting a user returns a success response (`success: "1"`) even when an incorrect key for the user ID is provided. The expected behavior is to receive a null response, indicating failure.

## Expected Behavior
The API should return a null response body, indicating the deletion failed due to the incorrect ID key.

## Actual Behavior
The API returns a response with body `[{"succes":"1"}]`, indicating the deletion was successful despite the incorrect ID key.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Call the API endpoint for deleting a user with an incorrect key for the user ID.
2. Observe the response.
